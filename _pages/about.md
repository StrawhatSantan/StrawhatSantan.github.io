Bolutife Atoki is a PhD student in Computer Vision at Université Lumière Lyon 2 (LIRIS) and a computer vision engineer focused on building robust visual perception systems. His work spans segmentation, detection, generative modeling, and multimodal learning, with research published at WACV 2026 and EUVIP 2024. He develops end-to-end vision pipelines for real-world R&D applications, from model design to evaluation and deployment-oriented analysis.

Research interests:
- Computer Vision
- Generative Modeling
- AI for image understanding
- Security and forensics-oriented vision systems
- Applied industrial R&D in vision

I am open to collaborations and R&D opportunities in computer vision across research and industry.

title: iOS AR Rubik's Cube Solver
description: Real-time AR cube detection, face identification, and guided solving pipeline on iOS.
importance: 5
category: applied-r-and-d
---

This project delivers an AR-assisted Rubik's Cube solver prototype for iOS. The system detects and localizes the cube, identifies visible faces, computes next moves, and overlays directional guidance arrows in real time.

Key outcomes:
- Implemented cube detection/localization and face identification with fine-tuned YOLOv5.
- Added color segmentation and move-guidance overlay.
- Integrated C++ backend into iOS/Xcode with static library and bridging setup.

Tech stack:
- C++
- iOS/Xcode
- YOLOv5
- Real-time computer vision
